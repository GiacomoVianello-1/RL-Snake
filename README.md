# Reinforcement Learning -- Snake Game

### Important aspects
- The original project template has been completely rewritten (without changing anything in the logic structure) in **PyTorch**.
- We make use of **cuda** acceleration to train the NNs faster (on GPU).
- Two different RL algorithms have been tested and compared:
    - **D3QN**: Dueling Double Deep Q-Network.
    - **PPO**: Proximal Policy Optimization.
